# Random password generator

This is a work in progress of a submission for the [March Code Challenge](https://twitter.com/codedex_io/status/1633156195472011278) issued by [Codedex.io](https://www.codedex.io/). The challenge:

> In this month's challenge, you will design a Python program that generates strong passwords. 🐍
> Generally, a strong password consists of at least the following:
> - One number (0-9)
> - One uppercase letter (A-Z)
> - One lowercase letter (a-z)
> - One special character (e.g., ! and _)
> Create a generate_password() function that generates a random strong password.

I have also decided to take up the extra challenge of solving this without using any modules or packages! That means writing my own random number generator.

If you want to join the challenge too, you can submit your solution on the Twitter post linked above by March 21, 2023.

## Note to Codedex challenge admin
If you end up considering this for the "special prize" (and if you're choosing the prize based on quality of the solution), please note that I am a more experienced user than many others on Codedex--I don't want to overshadow the amazing work of newer devs!
